(THIS PAGE IS UPDATING!)

<div align="justify">
Welcome to my page!
<br>
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Torino, focusing on Artificial Intelligence systems.
I have been working on projects integrating high-level planning with learning components (e,g, [IMPACT](https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/content/impact-intrinsically-motivated-planning-architecture-curiosity-driven-robots) ), and I am currently exploring neurosymbolic models that combine deep learning with prior knowledge.
<br><br>
My primary research interest lies in developing autonomous architectures capable of continuously acquiring new knowledge and leveraging it to efficiently learn further in a virtuous cycle. 
A central aspect of this challenge is the design of appropriate knowledge representations at all levels, from low-level skills to high-level concepts.
Identifying a unified framework for this remains an open challenge in the field.
<br><br>
I have also been a member of the Planning and Scheduling Team (PST) at the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC-CNR) in Rome, and part of the RoboCup Soccer SPL team Luxembourg United.

   * Models combining symbolic and sub-symbolic knowledge
3. Planning methods

If you're interested in writing a thesis on these topics you can contact me at <u>gabriele.sartor@unito.it</u> to have more details.


Other activities
======
<div align="justify">
I have been co-founder of the startup Stratobotic building stratospheric platforms to provide Earth observation and telecommunication services. 
Check out the website [stratobotic.com](https://www.stratobotic.com/).
<br>
If you're interested in participating to our activities writing your master thesis or to know if there are some available positions write at <u>info@stratobotic.com</u> or contact me.
Our main research topics in Computer Science are related to:
1. Mission control center applications (UI, telemetry, satellite data integration and planning)
1. Image processing
1. Trajectory optimization
