I am a Post-Doc at the Computer Science Department of Torino interested in everything related to Artificial Intelligence. I have already worked on projects integrating high level planning with learning components and I'd like to keep follwing this line of research. 
If you're interested in writing your master thesis on these topics feel free to contact me by email.
In addition, I participate to the CubeHAPS, project to build a stratosperic platform to provide EO and TLC services, in which I follow the software development activities.
I worked also on Remote Sensing classification models involving satellite data/images of Sentinel, ERA5 and GRACE (NASA).

Research interests
======
1. Reinforcement learning algorithms in simulated environments
1. Planning methods
1. Integration of deep learning techiques with planning methods
1. Remote Sensing models

If you're interested in writing a thesis on these topics you can contact me at <u>gabriele.sartor@unito.it</u> to have more details.

Other activities
======
I am also co-founder of the startup Stratobotic building stratospheric platforms to provide Earth observation and telecommunication services. Check out our website [stratobotic.com](https://www.stratobotic.com/). If you're interested in participating to our activities writing your master thesis or to know if there are some available positions write us at <u>info@stratobotic.com</u>.
Our main research topics in Computer Science are related to:
1. Mission control center applications (UI, telemetry, satellite data integration and planning)
1. Image processing
1. Trajectory optimization

Anyway, if you're interested in other topics such as electronics, telecommunication or aerospace engineering feel free to contact us!
