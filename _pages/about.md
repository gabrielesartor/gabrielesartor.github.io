(THIS PAGE IS UPDATING!)

<div align="justify">
Welcome to my page!
  
I am a Post-Doc at the Computer Science Department of Torino working on Artificial Intelligence systems.
I have been working on projects integrating high-level planning with learning components (e,g, [IMPACT](https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/content/impact-intrinsically-motivated-planning-architecture-curiosity-driven-robots)) and I am working on new Neurosymbolic models to integrate deep learning with prior-knowledge.

In particular, I am interested in studying architectures for autonomy able to learn continuously new knowledge, exploiting it to acquire efficiently new ones in a virtuous loop.
In this area it is central the choice of knowledge representation adopted at all the levels (from low-level skills to higher level concepts) and finding a unified framework is stil an open challenge.

I have been part of the Planning and Scheduling Team (PST) at the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC-CNR) of Rome, and the RoboCupSoccer SPL team Luxembourg United.

Research interests
======
1. Intelligent Agents
   * Knowledge abstraction
   * Option discovery (exploring Flow Matching + Imitation Learning)
   * Lifelong learning
2. Neurosymbolic models
   * Models combining symbolic and sub-symbolic knowledge
3. Planning methods

If you're interested in writing a thesis on these topics you can contact me at <u>gabriele.sartor@unito.it</u> to have more details.


Other activities
======
I am also co-founder of the startup Stratobotic building stratospheric platforms to provide Earth observation and telecommunication services. Check out our website [stratobotic.com](https://www.stratobotic.com/). If you're interested in participating to our activities writing your master thesis or to know if there are some available positions write us at <u>info@stratobotic.com</u>.
Our main research topics in Computer Science are related to:
1. Mission control center applications (UI, telemetry, satellite data integration and planning)
1. Image processing
1. Trajectory optimization

Anyway, if you're interested in other topics such as electronics, telecommunication or aerospace engineering feel free to contact us!
