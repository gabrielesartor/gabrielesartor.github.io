I am a Post-Doc at the Computer Science Department of Torino working on Artificial Intelligence systems.
I have been working on projects integrating high-level planning with learning components (e,g, [IMPACT]{https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/content/impact-intrinsically-motivated-planning-architecture-curiosity-driven-robots}) and I am working on new Neurosymbolic models to integrate deep learning with prior-knowledge.

Research interests
======
1. Neurosymbolic models (with focus on intelligent agents) <-- CURRENT FOCUS
2. Reinforcement learning algorithms in simulated environments
1. Planning methods

If you're interested in writing a thesis on these topics you can contact me at <u>gabriele.sartor@unito.it</u> to have more details.

Other activities
======
I am also co-founder of the startup Stratobotic building stratospheric platforms to provide Earth observation and telecommunication services. Check out our website [stratobotic.com](https://www.stratobotic.com/). If you're interested in participating to our activities writing your master thesis or to know if there are some available positions write us at <u>info@stratobotic.com</u>.
Our main research topics in Computer Science are related to:
1. Mission control center applications (UI, telemetry, satellite data integration and planning)
1. Image processing
1. Trajectory optimization

Anyway, if you're interested in other topics such as electronics, telecommunication or aerospace engineering feel free to contact us!
